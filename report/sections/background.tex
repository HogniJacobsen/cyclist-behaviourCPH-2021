With cities supporting bigger diversity than ever in modes of last-mile transportation,
having quantifiable data on cyclist movement is a key element in modern city planning. 
Movement patterns of cyclists and other traffic participants and the intersection in-between 
is to a large degree determined by the design of the shared infrastructure. 
Traditionally, analysis of traffic behavior has been dependent on manual human review, either by 
observing locations on-site or through recorded footage. This approach comes at a large cost 
and unless rigid methodology is defined beforehand, reports are often ad-hoc and qualitative in 
their nature. (<-- this is a bit lose). We aim to build a system that enables automatic capturing of behavioral 
patterns in traffic in a structured way through video analysis. The main benefit comes from the ability to 
scale the setup as low-cost hardware has become readily available.

One way to quantitatively assess cyclist behavior is to look at their travel trajectories in 
complex traffic junctions such as intersections.
