This study proposes a tool for automatic analysis of cyclists at intersections using video analysis. 
The setup is centered around the ‘staging mobilities’ framework, giving a planner both the ability to inspect cyclist traffic at intersections from multiple perspectives. 
All footage for experimentation was filmed with multiple cameras at the Dybbølsbro intersection in Copenhagen due to its complexities.
Using computer vision to detect cyclists from the videos, we extract the trajectories of cyclists and map them to a single aerial view from multiple sources.
A light web application was built to interact with the processed data. It shows the trajectories of individual cyclists over time and an aggregated view of the most common paths. Further, 
contextual analysis can be done for cyclists who have passed an area-of-interest marked on the areal view through references to the footage. 
We showcase the application of the tool at the Dybbølsbro intersection by inspecting cyclist counts and segments of footage in areas-of-interest. The results closely match the annotated data and are achieved in a short timespan.
