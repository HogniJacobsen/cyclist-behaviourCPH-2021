	Abstract = {We have developed an enhanced Littrow configuration extended cavity diode laser (ECDL) that can be tuned without changing the direction of the output beam. The output of a conventional Littrow ECDL is reflected from a plane mirror fixed parallel to the tuning diffraction grating. Using a free-space Michelson wavemeter to measure the laser wavelength, we can tune the laser over a range greater than 10 nm without any alteration of alignment.},

  abstract = {Traffic analysis is dependent on reliable and accurate datasets that quantify the vehicle composition, speed and traffic density over a long period of time. The utilisation of big data is required if equitable and efficient transportation networks are to be realised for smart, interconnected cities of the future. The rapid and widespread adoption of digital twins, IoT (Internet of Things), artificial intelligence and mini edge computing technologies serve as the catalyst to rapidly develop and deploy smart systems for real-time data acquisition of traffic in and around urban and metropolitan areas. This paper presents a proof of concept of a mini edge computing platform for real-time edge processing, which serves as a digital twin of a multi-lane freeway located in Pretoria, South Africa. Video data acquired from an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is processed using a neural network architecture designed for real-time object detection tracking of vehicles. The implementation successfully counted vehicles (cars and trucks) together with an estimation of the speed of each detected vehicle. These results compare favourably to the ground truth data with vehicle counting accuracies of 5% realised. Detection of sparse motorcycles and pedestrians were less than optimal. This proof of concept can be easily scaled and deployed over a wide geographic area. Integration of these cyber-physical assets can be incorporated into existing video monitoring systems or fused with optical sensors as a single data acquisition system.}

@book{designinig_mobilities,
title = "Designing Mobilities",
abstract = "How is the width of the pavement shaping the urban experience? How is the material design of transport infrastructure and mobile technology affording social interaction in everyday life spaces? How do people inhabit these spaces with their bodies and in accordance to social and cultural norms? These are some of the questions that this book raises in order to explore how the design of mobile sites and situations affect people's everyday life. The book takes point of departure in the author's book 'Staging Mobilities' (Routledge, 2013) in which it is argued that mobility is much more than simple movements of people, goods, and information 'from A to B'. Accordingly, the way people, goods, and information moves shapes the way we understand our built environment, other consociates, and ourselves. The book contributes with a new and critical-creative gaze on what might seem to be trivial and mundane acts of moving in the city. 'Designing Mobilities' is based on more than a decade of academic research by Professor of Urban Theory, Ole B. Jensen and a must-read for students and scholars with an interest in urban studies, urban design, architecture, urban planning, transport planning and geography, urban geography, anthropology, design studies, interaction design, and urban sociology.",
