research question(s)

Intro+Background: Good start, but you will need more. Have a look at nabaviniaki2019.pdf which I added to the dropbox. 
They do a review of methods - you could write something like a summary of that (without having to refer to all the references). 
Whenever you refer to some observed/hypothesized statement that someone did in the past try to give a reference, 
for example your argument about back-lash against bike culture - if you have read that somewhere then cite that source.

With cities supporting bigger diversity than ever in modes of last-mile transportation,
having quantifiable data on cyclist movement is a key element in modern city planning. 
Movement patterns of cyclists and other traffic participants and the intersection in-between 
is to a large degree determined by the design of the shared infrastructure. 
Traditionally, analysis of traffic behavior has been dependent on manual human review, either by 
observing locations on-site or through recorded footage. This approach comes at a large cost 
and unless rigid methodology is defined beforehand, reports are often ad-hoc and qualitative in 
their nature. (<-- this is a bit lose). We aim to build a system that enables automatic capturing of behavioral 
patterns in traffic in a structured way through video analysis. The main benefit comes from the ability to 
scale the setup as low-cost hardware has become readily available.

\chapter{Background}

Firstly we cover the technical advances in object detection over the past decade and its usage in traffic monitoring.

\subsection{Desire lines}
We look at how bicycle infrastructure (especially intersections) can be assessed. Here we'll mostly use 
trajectories and the idea of "desire lines" are metrics to focus on. (\cite{situ}). 



\subsection{Inclusive infrastructure}
Why it's important to understand cyclist behavior, and especially in cities with emerging bike infrastructure, \textit{how they adapt}.
We focus on the psychological aspects of a cyclist,

\begin{itemize}
	\item Perception of safety
	\item Intuitiveness (right-of-way should be obvious)
	\item Congestion (incl. waiting times)
	\item Rule compliance
\end{itemize}

If new cyclists feel uncomfortable (stress, embarrassment etc.) they're more likely to give up on the bike. This leaves the infrastructure 
under-used, which can further result in a back-clash against "bike culture".

\chapter{Method}

Figure \ref{system} summarizes the general methodology that will be discussed. We will focus
on three main components, Hardware and location, data pipeline and data analysis.

\subsection{Intersection selection}
There are three consideration to take into account when applying these methods to an intersection.
\ \\
1. Intersection size.
\ \\
2. Camera mounting points.
\ \\
3. Intersection composition

\subsection{Data collection}
Hardware
\ \\
Modern mobile phones offer high quality cameras in a compact design. We used an LG G6 as our recording device.
This device was chosen as it offers a 125 degree wide-angle camera lense. The field of view (FOV) of the camera is an important consideration
for large intersections, this is so that we can capture the entire intersection in one frame. To evaluate whether a camera is appropraite we use the following formula:
\[ tan(\theta ) = \frac{opposite}{adjacent}\]

Wide-angle-lenses do pose a problem as they suffer from lense distortion which is an optical aberration where straight lines appear bent.
The specific type being barrel distortion, where lines curve inwards in a shape of a barrel. This analysis did not correct for the distortion as ....

Battery life should also being considered depending on the intended amount of recording. 

\subsection{Data processing}

All general idea of the data processing steps are to connect observations as unique bicycle,
project the observations onto the street plane and then apply some methods of interpreting the data.

\ \\ 
\noindent
\begin{tabular}{@{}cc}
\includegraphics[width=1.0\columnwidth]{temp.png} 
\end{tabular}
\captionof{figure}{Data pipeline overview}
\label{data_pipeline}

The raw video is output as a .mp4 file this video file is if fed to YOLO v5 for object detection. YOLO, You Only Look Once,
is a real-time object detection algorithm. ....Explain more.... 
\ \\ 
Why YOLO v5?
\ \\ 
Objects are detected each frame and represented as bounding boxes.
The output from YOLO is as follows: \[ [frame id][xmin][ymin][xmax][ymax][confidence]  \]

The min and max values for x and y represent a bounding box for the identified bicylce.

Figure \ref{data_pipeline} demonstrates the data pipeline that the output from YOLO is fed through. .

In order to connect observations into trajectories of individual cyclist we apply 
simple online and real time tracking algorithm, SORT, as initially described in \cite{Bewley2016_sort}. 
SORT aims to address the problem of multiple object tracking (MOT) where object across frames needs to be connected. 
Explain more about SORT predict bbox then iou for actualy bbox.

The algorithm returns the bounding boxes along with a unique ID associated with each observation.

Using the bounding boxes we calculate the (x, y) co-ordinates of the observation and shift the y value down onto 
the same plane as the street so as to have the conact point of a bicycles and the street.

To transform the data to a birdseye view we needed to find the homography matrix, which is a transformation matrix between two planes.
The homography matrix (H) is a 3×3 matrix with 8 degrees of freedom, this allows the transformation of the cycling objects (Q) to a 
top-down piage view (P). 

\[ P = HQ \]

  \begin{align}
    P &= H\begin{bmatrix}
           x_{1} \\
           x_{2} \\
           \vdots \\
           x_{m}
         \end{bmatrix}
  \end{align}


\subsection{Data Interpretation}
As a baseline we deploy a vanilla OpenDataCam setup using its built-in tools for object counting and path recording.
From the OpenDataCam GUI it's possible to visually inspect the detected objects and draw line counters 
which keep track of the total number of objects passing the line given a certain areal threshold and approach angle. 
The line counters are bi-directional and segment totals based on the mode of transportation.

\ \\
The baseline will focus on the capabilities of only applying OpenDataCam and its tools. This will mostly be "trafic shares" for 
different paths and directions. 
\\ 
We then go on with further data processing as an extension. The main goal is to have a tool catered to analyzing cyclists, capturing
discrete desire lines (with magnitude) and the ability to "hook into" video material for certain scenarios.

\subsection{Hardware}
The pipeline for our setup is shown below on figure \ref{system}. OpenDataCam uses the Yolo4 weights to localize cyclists and pedestrians.
Processing was executed on an ARM based NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX (development board) equipped with a 384-core NVIDIA Volta GPU
and 8GB of memmory.

\end{tabular}
\captionof{figure}{System overview}
\label{system}

\ \\
The video feed for YOLO is provided through the OpenDataCam interface, which allows for real-time analysis through an onboard camera
or a video stream from an IP camera. 

\ \\
For further analysis the raw data from the recordings was exported in the form of CSV and JSON files. This includes both the low-level
object detection (bounding-boxes, frame reference, confidence levels etc.) and the totals from the line counters.

\subsection{Case study}
The Dybbølsbro intersection in Copenhagen was chosen as the location for our primary data collection. 
The Dybbølsbro intersection faces several traffic flow challenges as a result development in the immediate vicinity as well as being a large intersection.
These challenges make the Dybbølsbro intersection one of the more extreme in Copenhagen and would serve as a good base to this quantitative analysis method. 

To determine the desire paths that cyclist take throughout the Dybbelsbro intersection we recorded XX hours of footage 
at the Dybbølsbro intersection from X different camera angles.
The considerations taken in choosing a camera angle were:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Camera visibility to cyclists.
	\item Adequate mounting points, in terms of height and surface.
	\item Special attention was also given to making sure that cameras were not mounted on traffic signage.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Trajectory projection}
The video footage was analyzed using OpenDataCam which is an abstraction layer on top of Yolo. Yolo being an object detection library for object detection in images.
Once the video is analyzed by OpenDataCam, we receive a .json file containing a Unique ID for each identified cyclist that is detected for each frame of the video file. 
The unique ID is accompanied by bounding box coordinates of the detected bicycle on the frame. 
The center-bottom coordinates of the bounding box over multiple frames represents the track of an identified bicycle.

\ \\
By assuming the road as a 2D plane, hereby ignoring any non-linear deformations (e.g. from lens distortion or curvature of the pavement), 
we can transform the pixel positions from the video to real-world 2D coordinates. 
We calculate the \textit{homography matrix}, describing the transformation from one plane to another, by mapping four reference points from each frame (figure \ref{projection_figure}).
