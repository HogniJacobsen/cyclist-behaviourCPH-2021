With cities supporting bigger diversity than ever in modes of last-mile transportation,
having quantifiable data on citizen movement is a key element in modern city planning. 
Movement patterns of cyclists and other traffic participants and the intersection in-between 
is to a large degree determined by the design of the shared infrastructure. 
Traditionally, analysis of traffic behavior has been dependent on manual human review, either by 
observing the location on-site or through recorded footage. This approach comes at a large cost 
and unless rigid methodology is defined beforehand, reports are often ad-hoc and qualitative in 
their nature.
