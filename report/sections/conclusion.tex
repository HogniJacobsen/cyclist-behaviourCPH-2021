The study carried  out has been successfully achieved and satisfy the objectives of using homography 
matrix to convert image coordinate to  actual coordinate and  extracting data of  player motion 
from the video recording. The result shows a similar pattern be-tween the homography and image warp 
technique for the x-y coordinate results but varied slightly in speed and acceleration. 
This is comparable with published research  [14]. However, the  result can be improved further 
with better equipment and devices set up. In future, data that were recorded will be compared 
against wear-able based system such as GPS system.
