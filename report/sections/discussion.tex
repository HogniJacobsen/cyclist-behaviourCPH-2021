\subsection{Privacy}
We were wondering if privacy concerns are in the scope of the report? 
It would mostly be on filming in public and the latter storage of processing of the footage.

\subsection{Limitations}
We'll cover some issues and naive assumptions our system are based on. Most filming took place
mid-day with clear weather conditions. For instance, some of our footage was in heavy fog and had
 very low detection rates.

The intersection at Dybb√∏lsbro is also very large and thus allows for easier segmentation of road users. 
Smaller intersections with more congested areas may perform worse.
